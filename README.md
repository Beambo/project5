I then updated both servers to be sure that they are both with all the required updates.

This was then followed by the installation of mysql on both servers as confirmed in the screenshot below.

After this, i opened up port 3306 on the Server to allow connection from the IP of the client only. I then created a user on the Server as well as a Dataabase to access from the client in the screenshot below.
